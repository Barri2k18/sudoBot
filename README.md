# sudoBot
A Discord bot written in Python

## Getting Started

These are needed to be able to run **sudobot**.

- [Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/)
- [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)

## Setup

Edit `config.sample.json` to your liking, then save it as `config.json`.

Once you're ready just run `python bot.py` in the active directory to start the bot.

## Cogs

**Sudobot** has different modules that you can enable / disable. The current 'cogs' available are : 

- General : General commands used within a server. 
- Fun : Commands that are fun for users to play with, and serve nothing other than lighthearted spammy goodness.

Currently, the only way to enable / disable these are through `config.json` but this will change in the future.
